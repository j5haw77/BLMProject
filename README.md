# Black Lives Matter Twitter Map
## Jackson Shaw
This map displays a collection of tweets that include the "#blacklivesmatter" hashtag, collected using the Twitter API during three ten-minute increments spread throughout the day: one at 10:30 PM PST on June 9, 2020, the second at 10:30 AM on June 10, and the third at 4:30 PM on June 10. These tweets were collected from anywhere in the world.

This map's intention was to display the worldwide influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and reflect the injustice that the world as a whole shows toward non-white minorities. While the effectiveness of using Twitter activity as a measurement of worldwide engagement in the movement was inhibited somewhat by the language barrier and the disproportionate Twitter use in America and Europe in comparison with the rest of the world, the fact that only thirty minutes of Twitter activity contains tweets about the movement from all over the world does, in my opinion, justify this map as a compelling visualisation of the issue.
